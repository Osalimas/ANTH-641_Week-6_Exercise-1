# we have already grabbed a screenshot of Figure 2
# and have uploaded it into the folder 'figs-to-extract'

# when we run the line below, a 'wizard' takes over

# and from these, it will build up the dataframe
# that could produce this image.

# You will interact with the plot in the window on the right, and input information
# in the console window below.
