# Week 6 – Exercise 1 Extracting Data from PDFs

_There are many data available presented in peer-reviewed articles, monographs, and excavation reports in the form of data tables or graphical visualizations. A time-consuming way to extract that data is to copy the data table by hand. But there are also ways to extract that data using some open source software. __Important note: data that you retrieve from published sources are still under the same license as the text. Meaning, you need to cite this data just as you would the text and it is always appropriate when re-using data to make sure there are no ethical or legal restrictions.___

_There are two way to use Tabula to extract data tables from a pdf, one is to download the software onto your local machine and the other is to use it through R. We’ll try using both in this exercise._

## Using tabula to extract data from PDFs

1.	Open the tabula on your computer. Ask your instructor if it isn’t available on your computer. If it is not available, you can download it from [here](tabula.technology).
2.  You will have the downloaded PDF posted in this repo titled Garstki_2019_Social Production of Iron. In the tabula browser, browse to where you’ve download the PDF and import it into the software. You will see the PDF displayed in the software.
